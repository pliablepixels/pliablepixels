### Hi there 👋

I'm the developer of zmNinja, zmeventnotification, mlapi, pyzm and other interesting things for home security systems. I've had a lot of fun creating cool stuff for ZM over the last 6 years but have unfortunately run out of time to actively maintain these projects. [Read more here](https://forums.zoneminder.com/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=30996). I'll continue to fiddle around in my spare time, but can't offer active support.

All my original repos were moved over to ZoneMinder org - you'll see forked versions here. Please don't send any PRs my way, send them to the ZoneMinder repos please:
